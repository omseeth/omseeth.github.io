I'm joining the research collective “Building Benchmarks for Hate Speech Detection with Moral Rationales,” led by Francielle Vargas and Jackson Trager, contributing to work on representative data collection and explainable AI with a focus on safety, transparency, and cross-cultural contexts. It connects a diverse team of social psychologists, computer scientists, philosophers, and linguists from the Americas, Europe, and Australia. The project is partly sponsored by Google and Amazon Science. Link to publications and benchmarks can be found [here](https://franciellevargas.github.io/pages/MoralXplain.html). I'm looking forward to making fruitful contributions!
