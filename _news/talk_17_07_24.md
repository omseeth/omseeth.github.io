I spoke again at [Deutsche Telekom's AI Competence Center](https://www.telekom.com/en/company/digital-responsibility/details/artificial-intelligence-at-deutsche-telekom-1055154) about agency and AI.

**Title**: Agentic AI: What Can Philosophy Teach Us About Agency?
\\
**Abstract**: Agentic AI, such as AutoGen, Crew AI, and LangGraph, has recently garnered significant attention. Stanford's Andrew Ng, renowned for his neural network teachings on Coursera, has also lauded the use of multi-agent design patterns with LLMs in The Batch. The concept is straightforward: multiple LLM-powered agents collaborate to solve problems. By incorporating local memories and internal reflection capabilities, the resulting system of agents can be both powerful and complex. However, as critical AI philosophers, we must ask ourselves: do these agents truly possess agency, that is the ability to take action? To explore the potential of non-human agents, this talk will introduce fundamental definitions and conceptual tools to discuss agency in the context of LLM agents. It appears that agency is a continuous attribute, rather than a categorical one.
