Happy to discuss at [Deutsche Telekom's AI Competence Center](https://www.telekom.com/en/company/digital-responsibility/details/artificial-intelligence-at-deutsche-telekom-1055154) responsibility and AI.

**Title**: Why "Responsible AI" Is a Misnomer
\\
**Abstract**: The meaning of responsibility is closely attached to the idea of "responding" in a justified sense for one's deeds. For that matter, responsibility is also often interpreted as "answerability". The same holds for the German "Verantwortung" and the correlated idea of "Rede und Antwort stehen". However, (current) AI cannot be responsible for different reasons. Any existing AI system up to date lacks the capacity to reasonably justify itself. Another fundamental aspect of taking responsibility is also to accept consequences for certain actions, such as punishments for unlawful behavior. However, a machine learning system cannot be punished in any meaningful way. In short: AI is not responsible: Responsible AI is a misnomer. But who is responsible? And how can responsibility with AI look like?
