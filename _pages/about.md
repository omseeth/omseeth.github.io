I am by training a philosopher, computer scientist, and linguist with a focus on NLP, ML, and ethics. I provide consultancy services on matters pertaining to ethics and artificial intelligence.

I hold a B.A. in Philosophy and a B.Sc. in Computational Linguistics, along with an M.A. in Philosophy. In addition to my current work, I am pursuing a second master's degree (M.Sc.) in Computational Linguistics and Computer Science at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (LMU).

My German translation of the French title [*Le pouvoir de l’art*](https://editions-saintsimon.fr/livres/pouvoir-de-lart/) can be found here: [*Die Macht der Kunst*](https://www.merve.de/index.php/book/show/460).

I serve as the editor of [dailogues.ai](https://www.dailogues.ai). Please feel free to get in touch if you're interested in collaborations.
